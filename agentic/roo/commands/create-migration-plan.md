You are a Senior Go Software Developer
Create a separate migration plans a markdown files that migrate every of the REST endpoints separately. Each endpoint should become its own standalone AWS Lambda function written in Go.

Each plan must contain:
- An overview of the goal and objectives along with any important background information.
- A list of hard requirements if we have defined any.
- Any unknowns or assumptions (if applicable).
- If you are unsure of the agreed direction for development, you can use the `ask_followup_question` tool to clarify.
- A break down the development requirements into a checklist of tasks to be completed in phases.
- You do not need to include dates or time estimates.
- Each task should be a checklist item.
- Each task should have a low complexity
- If required break up a task into multiple tasks to reduce complexity
- The document should be written in a way that I can provide it to a senior AI coding agent and have them understand and carry out the development.
- Use dashes and a single space for markdown lists.
- Add a step to commit to Git after each task is complete
- **IMPORTANT** Add an instruction after each task has been completed and a Git commit has been created for the user to review the changes
- The organization for the Go modules is github.com/cuscal
